# Library Characterization Environment (LiChEn) Version 1.0

LiChEn is a program that provides support to the electrical characterization of standard cells, with special emphasis on specific components used to design asynchronous circuits. It enables the characterization of C-elements and NCL gates, but is not limited to these components. In this sense, LiChEn complements functionalities of commercial tools devised for circuit characterization, such as the Cadence ELC environment.

To compile LiChEn, just run the provided Makefile with the `make all` command.

## Requirements
LiChEn requires an electrical simulator installed in order to run the simulation files it generates.
Currently, LiChEn only supports the Cadence SPECTRE simulator.

## Example

The LiChEn distribution contains a characterization example for a 2-input AND gate cell. This cell was taken from the NanGate FreePDK45 Open Cell Library (http://www.nangate.com/?page_id=2325) that employs the NCSU FreePDK45 predictive 45nm technology node design kit (http://www.eda.ncsu.edu/wiki/FreePDK45:Contents). All these resources are open access. Also, our research group has available an open access asynchronous cell library based on that PDK and compatible with the NanGate FreePDK45 Open Cell Library. This is the ASCEnD-FreePDK45, available at https://corfu.pucrs.br/ascend-freepdk45/.

## Example

The current version of LiChEn (V1.0) is limited to characterize single-output cells only. This prevents its use to process some components that usually appear in several asynchronous design, such as mutual exclusion elements (mutexes) or cells supporting pseudo-static templates such as PCHB. A new version of LiChEn (V2.0) is under development to address such issues. This release is expected for early 2017.

## Credits

The LiChEn tool was proposed by Matheus Trevisan Moreira during his PhD research from 2012-2016. LiChEn V2.0 was the target of the End of Undergraduate Course Work of Guilherme Esp√≠ndola Medeiros in 2014. The current distribution of V1.0 was organized by Ricardo Aquino Guazzelli that is a an active user of LiChEn and elaborated the above mentioned example. These students are/were advised by Ney Calazans.
