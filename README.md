# Library Characterization Environment (LiChEn)

LiChEn provides electrical characterization support for asynchronous circuits.

To compile LiChEn, just run the provided Makefile with `make all`

## Requirements
LiChEn requires a electrical simulator installed in order to run the simulation files.
Currently, LiChEn only supports Cadence SPECTRE simulator.

## Example

The repository contains a characterization example of a 2-input AND gate using a [predictive 45nm technology node](http://www.eda.ncsu.edu/wiki/FreePDK), which can be acquired without any restrictions.
